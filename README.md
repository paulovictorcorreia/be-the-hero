# Be The Hero

In this repository it is the project designed by Rocketseat, a technology group from Brazil, on their 11th OmniStack Week, in which we built this project called Be The Hero, intended to help NGOs to find supporters for their projects. it was made by me during the classes given during the week.

It is developed using NodeJS and ReactJS on backend and frontend, respectivly. Also, originally, it has a mobile project also,, which can be seen in other similar repositories of this same project.

The backend is designed to:
* Register new NGOs and give them an access code
* Register new projects in which the NGOs want to be supported
* Give the NGO admin access to active projects

Finally, the frontend allows the NGO administrators to visually do all of these tasks.
